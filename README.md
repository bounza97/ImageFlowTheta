## ImageFlowTheta

This is a fork from the original [ImageFlow by Finn Rudolph](https://github.com/countzero/ImageFlow)

### What is this fork's raison d'Ãªtre?

ImageFlow is an excellent and beautiful JavaScript image gallery. Despite being an old script (the latest update was 13 years ago!), is responsive, 
so you can implement it without many issues on current websites... But, yeah, **there are** some issues. The main one is its touch control. Is awful!
So, with my limited JavaScript knowledge, I managed to implement a functional touchscreen control. 
Now you can control the gallery by swiping on it! Yeah, we're definitely living in the future! Cyberpunk 2077, here we ~~come~~ go!

Additionally, I updated some pieces of syntax. Mainly, I replaced the "var" keyword because its usage is no longer recommended 
(I'm a lazy ass, so I helped myself with an IDE). There are some bit of deprecated code, but, as I told you before, I'm a lazy ass, so the update
have to wait (I'm gonna update it some day; [I swear!](https://youtu.be/5a0MYtJaEKY?t=40))

Any suggestion is welcome, because, as you may guess, JavaScript is not my forte.
